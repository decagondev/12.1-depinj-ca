# BD Code-Along 12.1 - Dependency Injection

## Requirements

- IntelliJ with Java 11
- If you're running the code from your terminal, make sure you have Java 11 installed on your machine (not just in IntelliJ)

## Set Up

- Clone this repo and open it in IntelliJ. 
- Run the main method found in [App.java](./src/App.java). If that runs successfully, you are ready to go!
